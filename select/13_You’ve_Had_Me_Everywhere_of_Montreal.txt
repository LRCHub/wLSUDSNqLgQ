Listening to your heartbeat realizing it's my heartbeat too
'Cause if something were to happen to you
I would lose my mind and I'd never get it back
Listening to your breathing realizing it's my breathing too
Because if something were to happen to you...
Oh no I don't even want to think about that

There never seems to be enough time

I no longer feel like lying is just a form of self love,
At least not to the same degree
Diamanda Galas said that mortality is insulting
And now I tend to agree
Now I treasure the day we made the promise
To always sing No More Lonely Nights
You've inspired me unconsciously
Into somehow living my favorite life

Listening to your heartbeat realizing it's my heartbeat too
'Cause if something were to happen to you
I would lose my mind and I'd never get it back
Listening to your breathing realizing it's my breathing too
Because if anything happens to you...
Oh no I don't even want to think about that

There never seems to be enough time,
When the time is over it never seemed to be enough time
Always want more time with you

I no longer have to wonder who or what that I belong to
'Cause I belong to you
I've never been so proud to be tied up and to be spoken for
'Cause I belong to you
I remember when you dropped me off at JFK,
We kissed in traffic til the cops started bugging out,
Middle finger in the air 'cause that's our way of PDA,
You've had me everywhere, all over the world

Listening to your heartbeat realizing it's my heartbeat too
'Cause if something were to happen to you
I would lose my mind and I'd never get it back
Listening to your breathing realizing it's my breathing too
Because if anything happens to you...
Oh no I don't even want to think about that

Listening to your heartbeat realizing it's my heartbeat too
'Cause if something were to happen to you
I would lose my mind and I'd never get it back
Listening to your breathing realizing it's my breathing too
Because if anything happens to you...
Oh no I don't even want to think about that
