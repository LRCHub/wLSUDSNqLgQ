When i'm sure
I don't know why but i feel so insecure
And when it comes
It comes like a great big lull
But either way
I don't know why but i get so crazy
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots
When i'm home
I don't know why but i feel so all alone
And then you come barring down like an atom bomb
And i want to, but i want to
But i want to, but i feel all inside out
Want to, but i want to
But i want to, But i feel all inside out
Everywhere you turn
There's always something there
And all the time you're getting no where
Everywhere I don't know why but I get so crazy
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots
Well i'm sure
Sometimes i feel out a little more
And then it's hard
It's harder than it ever was before
But either way i don't know why but i get so crazy
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots
Yeah i want to, but i want to
But i want to, but i feel all inside out
Want to, but i want to
But i want to, but i feel all inside out
Everywhere you turn
There's always something there
And all the time you're getting no where
Everywhere I don't know why but I get so crazy
And all the thoughts get twisted in knots
Yeah i want to but i want to
But i want to but i feel all inside out
Want to but i want to
But i want to
But i feel all inside out
